Sometimes, it's useful to fully control your list page. I used to use [Leaf Bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/) to fulfill this requirement.

However, I found that using subsection to organize posts make my life easier, so I create a layout with only render the `_index.md` content and called this Blank Layout.

> This layout can only be used on section page (`_index.md`).
