I built my first blog through [hexo](https://hexo.io/) in early 2018. At that time, the features of hexo were able to meet most of my requirements. However, the desire to control and manage different types of content is getting higher and higher as time goes by.

So I designed and implemented [hexo-theme-book](https://github.com/kaiiiz/hexo-theme-book) in 2019 to provide a solution for customizable menu in hexo, but it's not perfect due to the architecture restriction.

Then I met [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and was amazed by its elegant architecture and blazing speed. So starting in the summer of 2020, I tried to integrate all my needs and started planning to transfer from hexo to hugo.
