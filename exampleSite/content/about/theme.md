I built my first blog through [hexo](https://hexo.io/) in early 2018. At that time, the features of hexo were able to meet most of my requirements. However, as time goes by, the desire to control and manage different types of content is getting higher and higher.

So I designed and implemented [hexo-theme-book](https://github.com/kaiiiz/hexo-theme-book) in 2019 to provide a solution for customizable menu in hexo, but it's not perfect due to the architecture restriction.

Then I met [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and was amazed by its elegant architecture and blazing speed. So starting in the summer of 2020, I tried to integrate all my needs and started planning to transfer from hexo to hugo.

At first, I only designed the prototype of the theme based on my personal needs, and then I gradually discovered that hugo's well-designed architecture allows me to abstract my personal needs into generic theme and apply it in different scenarios.

After a period of integration and testing, [hugo-theme-artisan](https://github.com/kaiiiz/hugo-theme-artisan) was born. This theme takes clean, responsive and highly customizable as philosophy. If you have any suggestions or improvements, feel free to open an issue or pull request on [github](https://github.com/kaiiiz/hugo-theme-artisan).

Hope this theme can let you experience the beauty of hugo. Enjoy!
