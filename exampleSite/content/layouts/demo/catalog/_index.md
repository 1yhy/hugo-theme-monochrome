Catalog layout is useful for customizing list contents.

The default list layout will list all pages under the current section, but with catalog layout, you can put any word in any place! (Just like regular page)

For example: [Go to catalog demo post 1](demo1), or [Go to home page](/hugo-theme-artisan)
